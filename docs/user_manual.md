# SummarAI — User Manual

## What it does

SummarAI takes a meeting recording and gives you back a written record you can actually use. Hand it an audio file or a text transcript, and it returns:

- a **summary** — two sentences on the meeting's purpose and outcome;
- **key takeaways** — the main points, each tagged as a *decision* or a *note*;
- **action items** — concrete tasks, with the owner and deadline whenever they were stated.

You can save any result into a **project**, so a team builds up a history of summarised meetings in one place.

The app works in English.

## Getting started

Open the app in a browser. If you are running it locally, follow the [installation guide](installation_guide.md) and then go to `http://localhost:8000`. No account or sign-in is needed.

The screen has a projects panel on the left (which you can hide with the ☰ button) and the summariser in the middle.

## Summarising a meeting

**1. Add the recording.** Drag a file onto the upload area, or click it to browse. SummarAI accepts:

| Type | Formats |
|---|---|
| Audio / video | `.mp4`, `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.webm`, `.ogg`, `.flac` |
| Text transcript | `.txt`, `.md`, `.vtt`, `.srt` |

If you upload audio, the app transcribes it automatically before summarising. Transcription runs locally — the audio never leaves your machine. If you already have the transcript as text, upload that instead and the app skips straight to summarising (faster, and no transcription errors).

**2. (Optional) Save it to a project.** Switch on *"Save this meeting to a project?"*, give the meeting a title, and pick a project. The result will be filed there once it finishes. You can create a new project from the panel on the left at any time.

**3. Click Summarise.** A progress bar shows the current step while it works. Audio takes longer than text, because it has to be transcribed first:

| Meeting length | Rough wait |
|---|---|
| Text transcript | a few seconds |
| ~10 minutes of audio | under a minute |
| ~30 minutes of audio | two to three minutes |

**4. Read the results.** Three cards appear:

- **Summary** — a two-sentence overview.
- **Key takeaways** — short bullets. Green ones are decisions; the others are notes.
- **Action items** — each task with its owner and deadline shown as small tags. Tick a task off to mark it done.

If the meeting had no real action items (for example, an informational briefing), the list will say so rather than inventing tasks.

## Working with projects

Open a project from the left-hand panel to see every meeting saved under it, laid out as a timeline. Click any entry to reopen the full summary, takeaways, and action items. You can delete individual meetings or whole projects from the same place.

On a phone the panel is hidden by default; tap the ☰ button to open it, and it tucks away again once you pick a project.

## Things to keep in mind

This is a proof of concept, and it has limits worth knowing before you rely on it:

- **It doesn't know who is speaking.** The transcription turns speech into text but doesn't label speakers. Action-item owners are taken from the words themselves, so if nobody is named ("can you handle that?"), the owner is left blank.
- **It assumes English audio.** The transcription model is tuned for English; other languages will transcribe poorly.
- **Audio quality matters.** Heavy background noise, strong accents, or people talking over each other will lower transcription accuracy, and that carries through to the summary.
- **It only hears the conversation.** Anything shown on a screen or whiteboard isn't captured.
- **Check before you share.** On occasion the model will surface an action item that was only implied, or miss one that was. Treat the output as a strong first draft, not a finished record.
